			The concept of tanks is old, dating back to almost 2000-3000 BCE when chariots were used as a platform for attacking with bows and arrows. 
			World War One saw the first use of the engine-driven, powerful metal beasts we know. 
			The first tanks were primitive and had limited speed, driving, and firing capabilities. 
			Despite these problems, it could withstand small arms fire and allowed soldiers to cross No Man's Land and penetrate enemy lines.

			After the war, countries continued researching and developing military technology. 
			At the beginning of World War Two, participating countries had at least some form of tank forces. 
			Nazi Germany, in particular, used them in concentrated masses and formations and are known as panzer divisions. 
			The successes of the Germans forced rivaling countries such as Britain and the US to develop better tanks and use them in a similar fashion.  
			The developments led to many variants and versions of tanks that were generally classified according to their role or specification.
			The links shown below were the classifications of the tanks according to their role. Click them to know more about that role.<br><hr>
