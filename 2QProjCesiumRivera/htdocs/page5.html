		Like tank destroyers, these were made with a dedicated purpose. 
		SPAAG, or Self-propelled Anti-aircraft gun, were AA guns mounted on trucks or the chassis of light tanks, and had a high rate of fire, elevation, and rotation to target fast aircraft.
		The idea of dedicated, mobile anti-aircraft guns started during World War 1, where the British and German forces mounted AA cannons on armored trucks.
		During World War 2, many of the SPAAGs were still truck mounted. 
		Nations such as Germany started using the chassis of other tanks, most notably the Wirbelwind. 
		A modified Panzer IV fitted with four 20mm cannons and the iconic 9-sided turret. 
		<br><br>
		Because of their powerful guns and high rate of fire, they were also used against infantry and lightly armored vehicles. 
		After the war, the development of missiles made the SPAAG less popular, but dedicated missile-only vehicles still exist to counter both ground and air targets.
