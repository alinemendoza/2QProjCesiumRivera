		Medium tanks were built to have the speed of light tanks and armor/firepower of a heavy tank. 
		These tanks would later become known as Main Battle Tanks (MBTs). The medium tank classification was only used during World War 2.
		They were also the most widely produced and successful tanks during that time. 
		Often used to support advancing units or as anti-tanks, they became the most common type, and most of the iconic tanks from the war (such as the M4 Sherman and Panzer IV) were medium tanks. 
		<br><br>
		Thanks to their industrial capacities, the United States and the Soviet Union produced large numbers of T-34 and M4 Sherman tanks, at about 106,000 units combined.
		The inclusion of radios in Nazi Germany's Panzer IV and Panzer III medium tanks proved to be extremely effective in battle because of their speed, firepower, and coordination.
