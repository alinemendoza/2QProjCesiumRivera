		These tanks were designed with only one thing in mind, to destroy other tanks. 
		This specific role only appeared during World War 2, and in later conflicts it was ignored because MBTs were much more practical. 
		However, some vehicle designs like anti-tank missile carriers serve the same purpose but only for assistance and long-range engagement against other tanks.
		These tanks were usually based on the chassis of other tanks and specifically equipped with a powerful anti-tank gun. 
		<br><br>
		Because the chassis weren't designed to handle the large guns, the tanks were turretless, meaning the gun was either fixed or had some slight elevation/turning pivot.
		Most American tank designs are exempted from this, and the absence of a turret provided more space inside the tank, either for the crew or a larger gun. 
		This also meant that they could be manufactured faster due to the availability of parts and ease of assembly.
