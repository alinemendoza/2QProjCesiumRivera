		Heavy tanks are a type of tank that features better, thicker armor and powerful armaments compared to their lighter counterparts.
		The addition of exceptional armor and guns made them very heavy, making its movements slow. 
		They were used from WW1 to the Cold War, and later abandoned due to the prevalence of MBTs (Main Battle Tanks) that made the use of heavy tanks obsolete.
		Heavy tanks were the most successful in fighting other lighter tanks and enemy fortifications, however, limited. 
		They had limited combat availability because of their speed and were instead used as moving fortresses or defensive positions. 
		<br><br>
		Most heavy tanks at that time had complex designs, and because of this they were manufactured at a slow pace and the cost per tank was very expensive.
		Examples include the German Tiger 1, which had many problems during its early development phase because of its over-engineered design.
