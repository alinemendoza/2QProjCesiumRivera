		Light tanks are tanks designed for speed and maneuverability in the battlefield. 
		They are generally smaller than most tanks and are equipped with weaker armaments and armor. 
		They were primarily used for reconnaissance and breaking enemy lines by using their speed to overwhelm the enemy.
		The concept of light tanks wasn't prevalent during World War 1 because the first tanks back then were slow.
		Only during World War 2 and in later conflicts were the light tanks utilized. 
		<br><br>
		Nazi Germany, famous for their blitzkrieg tactic, used swift attacks using mechanized infantry (tanks) and frequent aerial assaults to effectively
		paralyze and wipe out enemy forces. Light tanks primarily led the invasions while other units such as non-light tanks and infantry provided assistance.
